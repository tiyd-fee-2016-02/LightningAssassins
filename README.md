### To Remember ###
* Go to master branch and ```git pull```
* Then go to feature branch you're working on and ```git pull origin master```
* When you're done then git add, git commit, git push
* Don't make changes to the html in the wrong branch

* Did the html and styling for the main-page and detail-page
* Did the delete button modal for the edit-page
* Created a pile of broken JQuery & JSON code in an attempt to put the weather API on the detail-page
